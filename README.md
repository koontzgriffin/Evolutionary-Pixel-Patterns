# Welcome to Evolutionary Pixel Patterns where Art Meets Algorithm!

The genetic algorithm employed by this application functions as a heuristic search inspired by natural selection and genetics, aiming to generate optimal solutions for drawing patterns on a 2D grid of pixels. In the initialization phase, a population of potential solutions, represented as individuals with randomly generated patterns, is created. The fitness of each individual is assessed based on how well its pattern adheres to a set of given constraints. Through successive generations, individuals are selected, undergo crossover and mutation, mimicking genetic processes, and create offspring with potentially improved fitness. The algorithm iteratively refines the population, guiding the evolution towards patterns that increasingly satisfy the specified constraints, ultimately producing aesthetically pleasing and constraint-compliant visual compositions on the pixel grid.
